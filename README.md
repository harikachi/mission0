This is as part of mission-0 to implement the wireframe of a listing website home page

As part of this mission I need to create a web page which is mobile responsive.

Below are the requirements:
 
The digital team would like to prototype a solution that resembles the wireframe below.
Build an application using any front-end framework of your choice with a home page using the wireframe shared as guidance.
You can use your own color palette and pictures.
Search functionality need not be implemented.

I have used react as the front end framework along with CSS and HTML.
