This is as part of mission0 to implement the wireframe of a listing website home page

Need to create 1 page with a mobile responsive layout.  
Below are the requirements:
 
The digital team would like to prototype a solution that resembles the wireframe below.
Build an application using any front-end framework of your choice with a home page using the wireframe shared as guidance.
You can use your own color palette and pictures.
Search functionality need not be implemented.

I have used react as the front end framework along with CSS and HTML as part of this project.
